using Python

by Sean Sungil Kim

This project is a follow-up of the GTSRB Traffic Sign Recognition Project Part I. The objective of this project is the same as that of Part I. In this project, another feature extraction method named Histogram of Oriented Gradients will be explored. In addition, combinations of the feature extraction and feature selection/dimensionality reduction methods are analyzed.
